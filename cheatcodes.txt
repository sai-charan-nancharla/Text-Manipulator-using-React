-> Routing or router in web development is a mechanism where HTTP requests are routed to the 
    code that handles them. To put simply, in the Router you determine what should happen when 
    a user visits a certain page.


    Router is used to Route from one component to another component without reloading the page
    which are imported from "react-router-dom"

   Link tag is used in place of angular tag and to is used in place of href for path

     <Link className="nav-link active" aria-current="page" to="/">Home</Link>  (Navbar.js)
    
   Routes is new switch in latest version every Route must be wrapped up in BrowserRouter tags
   <Route path="" element={<component />} />  is used in (app.js) 
   
   <Route>s can be nested. The first <Route> has a path of / and renders the Layout component.

        or any server .Because,it contains the content we created for the website.

        npm run build creates a build directory with a production build of your app. Set up your favorite 
        HTTP server so that a visitor to your site is served index.html, and requests to static paths 
        like /static/js/main.<hash>.js are served with the contents of the /static/js/main.<hash>.js 
        file. For more information see the production build section.
